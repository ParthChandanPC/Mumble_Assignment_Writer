### Mumble_Assignment_Writer

Goals:
1. To provide log-in page, and enable OTP verification
2. To extract text from PDF
3. Generate "well - formatted" random text.

Progress:
1. Implemented login page for both those who are already registered and those who are new users along with otp verification page but sending otp to mobile number was not possible as it is paid.
2. Extracted the text successfully and generated its raw .txt file via pure python code and python libraries. Just frontend implementation is not present currently.  
3. Successful generation of random text, not well formatted so far. but SOON!
